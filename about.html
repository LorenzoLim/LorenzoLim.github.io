          <h2 class="text-description">Don Bosco Technology Center</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">I was born and raised in the Phillipines and started my schooling at Don Bosco Technology Center. As a young child I always had an interest in technology. I always wanted to know how a computer worked because as a child I thought it was just magic. I had an old Dell computer and one day the mouse broke so I tried learning how to navigate the computer with only the keyboard and I learnt so much by just testing around. Even with my old toys, I loved taking them apart just to see how they ticked. I also really liked puzzles as a kid and I loved solving problems. During my schooling at this time, I was mainly in the library using the old computers playing with paint or whatever I could find.</p>
          <div id="ucsc"></div>
          <h2 class="text-description">Upper Coomera State College</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">2006 was the year that me and my family moved to Australia and I was introduced to a completely different culture. During year 7 I heard about an I.T. summer camp and I wanted to apply but apparently you had to be offered a spot. However, this did not stop me and I went to the principal with all my forms and payment ready to go and she was impressed and told me "This is unusual but first in best dressed". I was given the spot and I learnt how to do some game coding which made me really happy. I made a lot of other people that were also interested in computers and I made a lot of friends during that program.</p>
          <div id="qibt"></div>
          <h2 class="text-description">Queensland Institue of Business and Technology</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">After graduating from UCSC I took up a Diploma of Information Technology at the Queensland Institue of Business and Technology. At the time I took that course because it would give me direct entry into Griffith University as it was a sister school of theirs and had all the required courses for the first year of the Bachelor of Information Technology. This was the first time I had to commute to a location that isn't local since I was living in Gold Coast while the diploma course was up in Brisbane. This diploma was a year long and I achieved two high distinctions which filled me with a sense of accomplishment. I loved coding and developing so after taking this Diploma course, I knew that I.T. is where I wanted to go.</p>
          <div id="griffith"></div>
          <h2 class="text-description">Griffith University</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">After graduating from QIBT and achieving my diploma, I was given direct entry to Griffith University with a Bachelor of Information Technology. I went straight the second year of the Bachelor as I completed all my necessary requirements for first year. I made many network connections during my schooling days at Griffith University and many friends that were also interested in the same things I was also interested in. I worked with many other students as couple of the assessments of some courses required work to be done it groups which I found very useful because it allowed me to feel what it is like to work in a group in a professional setting.</p>
          <div id="organica"></div>
          <h2 class="text-description">Organica Skin Care Clinic</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">I found it difficult finding a first job because I was mainly focusing on my schooling during highschool and didn't really consider getting a job a priority. I now regretted being complacent but I am lucky to have been given a job offer by the owner of Organica Skin Care Clinic as a contractor. I did tasks from as simple as delivering laundry to fixing computers. It was a good start because I learnt a lot about professional expectations and to be serious with my work even if it's simple.</p>
          <div id="brygon"></div>
          <h2 class="text-description">Brygon Medical Centre</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">The owner of Organica Skin Care Clinic also owned a medical centre and offered me a job there as a receptionist. I currenty work as a receptionist at this medical centre and I love this job because it allows me to be around computers even though most of the work is just data entry and arriving patients. Even though it's not part of my job description, I usually fix things that get broken around the office. When something get's broken I take the initiative and try to fix it. I really do enjoy fixing things even if I don't get any gratification or a thank you from anyone. I just love knowing that I had achieved something.</p>
          <div id="haiyan"></div>
          <h2 class="text-description">Typhoon Haiyan Disaster Relief</h2>
          <p class=" text-description-details">During the Typhoon Haiyan Disaster I volunteered to help during the relief efforts in Brisbane. I sorted clothes and carried packages around the warehouse. I also assisted in filling up a shipping container with good and supplies to be sent to the disaster area. It felt good doing that kind of work as I knew that it was helping someone in need.</p>
